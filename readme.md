# Hack the North 2020 Backend Boilerplate

This boilerplate contains a sqlite + Flask install. The current directory is mounted as a volume under `/home/api` so that you do not have to rebuild the image every time. Building and running the image will start the Flask server on port 5000.

Good luck!
