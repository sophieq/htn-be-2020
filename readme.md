### Tests 
I tested my API endpoints using Postman and Google Chrome using a `sample.json`, a subset of the `data.json`. Unfortunately curl was not working on my mac :/ . 

## Future Improvements
Some things to improve/add on:
* currently DELETE will always return a success message, whether or not user actually attended event
* throw JSON error for invalid user_id and event_id when trying to add or remove attendee from event
* add a get all events api

Scalable improvements:
* If users columns grow, we should me location (lat, long) into a seperate table 
* Add layers of security if for example we don't want to user getting requests to see user locations
